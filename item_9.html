      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>6- 8 kokum or aamsol
          </li>
          <li>1 cup of fresh grated coconut
          </li>
          <li>1 cup of hot water 
          </li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic or 1 tsp of ginger
          </li>
          <li>1 - 2  green chillies
          </li>
          <li>A pinch of asafoetida (heeng)
          </li>
          <li>Rock Salt to taste
          </li>
          <li>Coriander leaves for garnish
          </li>
      </ol>	
      <h3>How To Cook</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Soak the kokum in about 3/4th cup water adding the heeng and salt. Keep aside for 3 - 4 hours.
          </li>
          <li>Grind the grated coconut, garlic and chillies together with little water in a blender or mixer. When it grinds to a
              thick paste like texture, squeeze the 'milk' out of the paste and keep aside.
          </li>
          <li>Add another 3/4th cup of water to the dry remains and run the mixer again for a minute or so. Again extract the milk
              - adding to the original extract.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat this process two to three times till basically all the 'milk' gets extracted from the coconut .
          </li>
          <li>NOTE :This process can be repeated a couple of times, but bear in mind that the milk gets thinner with every
              consecutive extraction.
          </li>
          <li>Discard the kokum from the water, add the coconut milk mixture into the kokum water, mix well to get a creamy pink
              coloured solkadhi.
          </li>
          <li>Taste it and adjust seasoning as required.
          </li>
          <li>Keep aside for an hour or more .
          </li>
          <li>NOTE: It is important to let the Solkadhi rest  for at least an hour before you consume it.
          </li>
          <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve chilled.
          </li>
          <li>Chef's Tip : And remember to stir the Kadhi every time you serve it - the coconut extract tends to rise to the top
              when the kadhi is left untouched for a bit!
