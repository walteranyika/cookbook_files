          <li>2-3 Tbsp oil
          </li>
          <li>1 tsp cumin seeds
          </li>
          <li>1 green chilli finely chopped
          </li>
          <li>1 tsp chopped garlic
          </li>
          <li>2 onions - sliced

      <h3>How To Cook</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan, add the cumin seeds and allow them to sizzle.
          </li>
          <li>Add the green chilli, garlic and onions. Cook until softened. Add the potato slices to the pan. Cook without
              coloring for 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Pour in enough water to come just below the contents of the pan. Cover and cook over a low heat until the potato is
              tender. Sprinkle the coriander.
          </li>
          <li>Mix ingredients and level out again. Make four indentations in the mixture, about 1/2" away from the pans side.
              Break an egg into each hollow.
          </li>
          <li>Cover and cook until the eggs are just set. Cut into 4 segments and serve with bread and salad.
          </li>
